Create an Edit Menu in your GUI

Add a second menu to the GUI called Edit which will have one menu item called Search. Clicking on search should prompt the user using a JOptionPane input dialog to enter a candleâ€™s price. The GUI should then display only candles at or below that price. You will need to write a second menu handler called EditMenuHandler.
